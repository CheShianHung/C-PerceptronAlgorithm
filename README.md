# C-PerceptronAlgorithm
This C++ program uses perceptron algorithm to classify three classes. Each class contains thirty samples. Fifteen samples for training, and fifteen samples for verifying the trained classifiers. The program can manually set the problem to non-linearly separable problem by swapping one sample among three classes for training and testing.
